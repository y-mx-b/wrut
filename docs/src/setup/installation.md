# Installing `wrut`

`wrut` can be installed through `cargo`:

```sh
cargo install wrut
```

You can also decide to build `wrut` from source. If so, simply clone the
directory and run `cargo build --release` to build `wrut`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/y-mx-b/wrut.git
cd wrut
cargo build --release
./target/release/wrut --help
```

Installation scripts are planned for the future, perhaps when `wrut` hits 1.0.
